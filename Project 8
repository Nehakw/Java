Project: Locate the largest element

Problem Description:
Write the following method that returns the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array.

public static int[] locateLargest(double[][] a) 

The return value is a one-dimensional array that contains two elements. These two elements indicate the row and column indices of the largest element in the two-dimensional array. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional array and displays the location of the largest element in the array. Here is a sample run:

<Output>
Enter the number of rows and columns of the array: 3 4
Enter the array: 
23.5 35 2 10
4.5 3 45 3.5
35 44 5.5 9.6
The location of the largest element is at (1, 2)
<End Output>


Analysis:
(Describe the problem including input and output in your own words.)

The goal of this program is to return the largest element in a two-dimensional array. The program should ask the user to enter the number of rows and columns in an array. After entering the number of rows and columns, it should ask the user to enter array elements. Once the user has entered the array elements, the program should find the largest element from the array and return the co-ordinates of the rows and columns of the two-dimensional array. The output must be a one-dimensional array with two elements which indicates the row and column indices.

Design:
(Describe the major steps for solving the problem.)

1.	In main method create a scanner object for accepting user enter number of rows and columns
2.	Create an integer variable for storing rows and column values
3.	Create a two-dimensional array for storing elements in row and columns
4.	Prompt the user to enter array elements
5.	Create a for loop for initializing the user entered values of rows elements
6.	Create a for loop for initializing the user entered values of column elements
7.	Store the initialized values into two-dimensional array
8.	Call a method for finding the location of largest element in an array
9.	Store the largest element into integer variable named location
10.	Print the location of the largest element
11.	Create a method named locateLargest for finding the largest element from the entered array
12.	Create an integer variable named location for storing the location of largest element and initialized it to {0, 0}
13.	Create a for loop to read all the elements in the row
14.	Create a for loop to read all the elements in the column
15.	Compare row and column with the largest element 
16.	Assign the index of largest element of row
17.	Assign the index of largest element of column
18.	Store the largest element into largest variable
19.	Return the location of the largest element
