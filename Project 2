Project Name: Calculating Future Investment Value


Problem Description:

Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays the future investment value using the following formula:
and displays the future investment value using the following formula:

futureInvestmentValue = 
  investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears*12

For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98. 

Hint: Use the Math.pow(a, b) method to compute a raised to the power of b. 

Here is a sample run:

Sample 1:
Enter investment amount: 1000
Enter annual interest rate: 4.25
Enter number of years: 1
Accumulated value is 1043.34

Sample 2:
Enter investment amount: 1000
Enter annual interest rate: 4.25
Enter number of years: 1
Accumulated value is 1043.34

Analysis:
(Describe the problem including input and output in your own words.)

Here, we have to compute the future investment amount.
For this, I used three inputs:
1)	Amount that is invested as investmentAmount.
2)	Annual interest rate as monthlyInterestRate.
3)	Number of years the amount invested as numberOfYears.
After applying the mentioned formula, I stored my output in futureInvestmentValue variable.




Design: 
(Describe the major steps for solving the problem.)

I performed following steps for executing the program:

1)	Created the scanner object for reading user inputs from keyboard
2)	Read in the investment amount 
3)	Read in the annual interest rate: for finding the annual interest rate we have to divide the interest rate by 1200 (12 as there are 12 months in a year and multiplied it with 100 since it is a percentage)
4)	Read in the number of years the amount invested
5)	Compute the investment amount using the formula:
        
futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfYears * 12)


Coding: (Copy and Paste Source Code here. Format your code using Courier 10pts)

import java.util.Scanner;
public class FutureInvestment {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		// Create a Scanner
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		// Enter the investment amount
		System.out.print("Enter the investment amount:");
		double investmentAmount = input.nextDouble();
		
		// Obtain monthly interest rate 
		System.out.print("Enter annual interest rate:");
		double monthlyInterestRate = input.nextDouble();
		monthlyInterestRate /= 1200;
		
		// Enter number of years
		System.out.print("Enter number of years:");
		int numberOfYears = input.nextInt();
		
		// Calculate the future investment value
		double futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfYears * 12);
		
		// Display result 
		System.out.println("Accumulated value is $" + futureInvestmentValue);
		

	}

}



Testing: (Describe how you test this program)

For testing the source code, I performed following steps:

1)	I checked the syntax of all the variables and identifiers
2)	All the statement ends with semicolons.  
3)	I checked whether all the declared variable have follow the data type consistency i.e. cross-checked variable that are declared as integer, double is assigned with the same data type.
