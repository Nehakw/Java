Project: The Account Class


Problem Description:
(The Account class) Design a class named Account that contains: 
•	A private int data field named id for the account (default 0).
•	A private double data field named balance for the account (default 0).
•	A private double data field named annualInterestRate that stores the current interest rate (default 0). Assume all accounts have the same interest rate.
•	A private Date data field named dateCreated that stores the date when the account was created.
•	A no-arg constructor that creates a default account.
•	A constructor that creates an account with the specified id and initial balance.
•	The accessor and mutator methods for id, balance, and annualInterestRate. 
•	The accessor method for dateCreated. 
•	A method named getMonthlyInterestRate() that returns the monthly interest rate.
•	A method named withdraw that withdraws a specified amount from the account.
•	A method named deposit that deposits a specified amount to the account.

Draw the UML diagram for the class. Implement the class. Write a test program that creates an Account object with an account ID of 1122, a balance of $20,000, and an annual interest rate of 4.5%. Use the withdraw method to withdraw $2,500, use the deposit method to deposit $3,000, and print the balance, the monthly interest, and the date when this account was created.






Analysis:
(Describe the problem including input and output in your own words.)

The aim if this project is to create a loan account class. At first, we have to create an instance on an account class. Here, we have to pass the account id, balance and annual interest rate. Then with the help of withdraw method we have to withdraw $2,500 from the account and deposit $3,000 into the account. Final output should display the balance in the account along with the monthly interest rate and date the account was created.

Design:
(Draw an UML class diagram for the Account class.)

1.	In main method create an instance object of an account class
2.	Pass 4.5% annual interest rate to setAnnualInterestRate method
3.	Withdraw $2,500 from the account by calling withdraw method
4.	Deposit $3,000 into account by calling deposit method
5.	Display the account balance, interest rate and date when the account was created
6.	Create account class
7.	Initialized id, balance, annualInterestRate and creation date 
8.	Create a no arg constructor
9.	Create argument constructor with specific id and balance
10.	Create an accessor and mutator method for id, balance, annualInterestRate
11.	Create a method for calculating annual interest rate
12.	Create a method for withdrawing from account
13.	Create a method for depositing into the account

public class Exercise09_07 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Create an instance object of a account class
		Account account = new Account(1122, 20000);
		account.setAnnualInterestRate(4.5);
		account.withdraw(2500);
		account.deposit(3000);
		
		// Display Balance, Monthly interest rate and date created
		System.out.println("Balance is " + account.getBalance());
		System.out.println("Monthly interest is " + account.getMonthlyInterest());
		System.out.println("This account was created at " + account.getDateCreated());

	}

}

// Create an account class
 class Account
 {
	 private int id = 0;
	 private double balance = 0.0;
	 private double  annualInterestRate = 0.0;
	 private java.util.Date dateCreated;
	 
	 public Account()
	 {
		 dateCreated = new java.util.Date();
	 }
	 
	 //Create a constructor with specific id and balance
	 public Account(int id, double balance)
	 {
		 this();
		 this.id = id;
		 this.balance = balance;
	 }
	 
	 // Accessor and mutator method for id, balance and annualInterestRate
	 public int getId()
	 {
		 return this.id;
	 }
	 
	 public double getBalance()
	 {
		 return this.balance;
	 }
	 
	 public double getAnnualInterestRate()
	 {
		 return annualInterestRate;
	 }
	 
	 public String getDateCreated()
	 {
		 return this.dateCreated.toString();
	 }
	 
	 public void setId(int id)
	 {
		 this.id = id;
	 }
	 
	 public void setBalance(double balance)
	 {
		 this.balance = balance;
	 }
	 
	 public void setAnnualInterestRate(double annualInterestRate)
	 {
		 this.annualInterestRate = annualInterestRate;
	 }
	 
	 // Define method getMonthlyInterestRate
	 public double getMonthlyInterestRate()
	 {
		 return (annualInterestRate / 100) / 12;
	 }
	 
	 public double getMonthlyInterest()
	 {
		 return balance * getMonthlyInterestRate();
	 }
	 
	// Define method withdraw
	 public void withdraw(double amount)
	 {
		 this.balance -= amount;
	 }
	 
	// Define method deposit
	 public void deposit(double amount)
	 {
		 this.balance += amount;
	 }
 }


Testing: (Describe how you test this program)

After running the program with inputs as following:
Account id: 1122
Balance: $20,000
Annual interest rate: 4.5%
Amount to withdraw: $2,500
Amount to deposit: $3,000
